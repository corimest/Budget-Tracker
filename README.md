# Budget Tracker Starter Code

## Description

An update to an existing budget tracker application that allows offline access and functionality. A user will now be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection.

## User Story

    AS AN avid traveler
    I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
    SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling 
    


## Deployed Link

Everything was working so well until I tried to deploy it to Heroku. Now it's broken, I can't figure it out, and I can't look at it anymore. So, you can try going to https://nameless-refuge-75037.herokuapp.com/, but I doubt it will work right now.
